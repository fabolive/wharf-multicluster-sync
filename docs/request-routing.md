# Request Routing

How can we achieve the Request Routing functionality
as described in https://istio.io/docs/tasks/traffic-management/request-routing/ ?

First, let's look from the point of view of the providing service.  The operator of the _Donor
Cluster_ *cluster-b* wishes to
expose the *Reviews* service to remote cluster *cluster-a*.  She writes a _ServiceExpositionPolicy_:

```
apiVersion: multicluster.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceExpositionPolicy
metadata:
  name: reviews-sep
  namespace: default
spec:
  exposed:
  - name: reviews
    clusters:
    - cluster-a
```

Now the operator of the _Donor cluster_ wishes to roll out a new version, but have no
traffic be routed to it.  The operator should be able to use the same command as
in the single-cluster use case:

```
kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-all-v1.yaml
```

This creates an Istio *VirtualService* for review.  Because there is now a VirtualService
for reviews the existing ServiceExpositionPolicy `reviews-sep` prefers to use the definition
and all traffic will be routed to pods labeled `version: v1`.

The operator of the Donor cluster then deploys v2 and wishes to route a single user's
traffic to it.

```
kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/virtual-service-reviews-test-v2.yaml
```

This should work exactly as it does in the single cluster configuration.

Now let's take a look at the steps performed by the operator of the _Acceptor cluster_.
Initially this operator signaled that it wanted to use the remote Reviews like this:

```
apiVersion: multicluster.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: RemoteServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: reviews-rsb
  namespace: default
spec:
  remote:
  - cluster: cluster-b
    services:
    - name: reviews
```

By doing this KubeDNS knows to create an entry for `reviews.default` because a new Istio Component created a Virtual Service _reviews_ (and maybe some other stuff).

At this point suppose a bug in version v2 is discovered that is so serious we don't want
even the single user "jason" from the _virtual-service-reviews-test-v2.yaml_ example
to use v2.

If the operator of cluster-a and cluster-b are part of the same team it is easy to have
them perform the same operations as before and apply _virtual-service-all-v1.yaml_ again
upon the donor cluster.
However, if this problem is discovered by the acceptor cluster and the donor cluster
team is unresponsive there is no way to fix this with the steps we have taken so far because
the labels are not exposed and rules applied in the acceptor cluster cannot control routing.

To provide some control for the acceptor cluster we introduce the best practice of using
"donation aliases".  Under this practice, in addition to the rules configuring the defaults
the donor operator creates named aliases:

```
# "reviews-v1" is just virtual-service-all-v1.yaml with a different name and hosts
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-v1
  ...
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews-v1
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
---
# "reviews-test" is just virtual-service-reviews-test-v2.yaml with a different name and hosts
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-test
  ...
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews-test
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        end-user:
          exact: jason
    route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
---
apiVersion: multicluster.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceExpositionPolicy
metadata:
  name: reviews-sep
  namespace: default
spec:
  exposed:
  - name: reviews
    clusters:
    - cluster-a
  - name: reviews-v1
    clusters:
    - cluster-a
  - name: reviews-test
    clusters:
    - cluster-a
```

(Initially I had thought it would be sufficient to use "tag" and "alias" instead of
recreating the VirtualServices with aliases themselves.  However it is much more
powerful to have VirtualService "aliases").

Because the Donor Operator exposed three configurations for reviews the Acceptor operator
has a choice.  The details of the routing to the three exposed configurations are encapsulated
but in this case the two operators agreed.  When the Acceptor operator decides to roll back
or end the experiment they can do it using the exposed names.

```
apiVersion: multicluster.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: RemoteServiceBinding
metadata:
  name: reviews-rsb
  namespace: default
spec:
  remote:
  - cluster: cluster-b
    services:
    - name: reviews-v1
      alias: reviews
```

This RemoteServiceBinding creates in the Acceptor cluster a Service and/or VirtualService "reviews"
but that actually points to the reviews-v1 service on cluster-b.  This allows the
operator of cluster-a to "roll back" without needing permission or assistance from the Donor operator
of cluster-b, provided the Donor exposed a VirtualService with the needed request routing.
